Features
Real-Time Neurofeedback: Provides instant feedback based on brainwave activity (EEG data) using interactive visualizations.
Personalized AI Feedback: Utilizes machine learning models to offer personalized feedback on attention, relaxation, and other cognitive functions.
Customizable Training Sessions: Users can choose different training modes (e.g., focus, relaxation, mindfulness) and difficulty levels.
Session History and Progress Tracking: Stores and displays historical data to track cognitive improvements over time.
Responsive and Interactive UI: Built using React.js with a modern design that adapts to all devices.
Real-Time Data Streaming: WebSocket-based streaming of EEG data to the server for immediate processing and feedback.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js: User interface development with reusable components.
Material-UI (MUI): Modern, responsive design elements.
D3.js / Recharts: Data visualization for real-time brainwave patterns and session metrics.
WebSocket: Real-time data transmission between EEG devices and the server.
Backend:
Node.js: Server-side logic and API management.
Express.js: Web framework for handling routes and middleware.
MySQL: Database for storing user sessions, EEG data, and training progress.
Machine Learning:
Python (Flask): Machine learning API that processes EEG signals and provides personalized feedback.
TensorFlow / Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for analyzing brainwave patterns.

Machine Learning
The Flask ML service runs real-time EEG signal processing and prediction. The models are trained on different brainwave frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, delta) to analyze cognitive states like attention and relaxation.

Key functionalities:

EEG Signal Processing: Feature extraction from raw EEG data.
Model Training: Pre-trained models using TensorFlow or Scikit-learn.
Real-Time Predictions: Provides cognitive state predictions and personalized feedback during sessions.
